# Book app day 2

I was sick yesterday and tried to help as much as I could via slack, but me and George are truly at an impasse with routes and just trying to get the basics up and running from day one. We didn't even have a chance to look at the lab really from today but I turned in what we did have in hopes we can make something work tomorrow and play catch up. ONWARD AND UPWARD.
