# 401 Learning Journal day 4

Today we learned the AWS server. We set up accounts and learned how the AWS is the storage to the mongodb items. Since mongodb can't store things like pictures or other big objects, you need to use AWS to do so and just put references to the AWS links that are created. Going through the information today it was a lot to take in, so I will use what we went through and try to experiment with it to get more experience and hopefully understanding will come with due time.
