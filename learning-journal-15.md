# Learning journal 15

Over all the busmall project went pretty smoothly and I didn't really make any changes since the last day we worked on it in lab since I had pretty much polished it to a good point I think. More css would have just added clutter which can turn bad fast. Observationally I learned that charts are a very useful and easy way to implement data using libraries in js.

This weekend we also ironed out who is doing what with a wire frame in our project and should be able to get it done by monday, but we will see where everyone stands.
