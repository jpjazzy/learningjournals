# Finishing the book app

Our book app week has been a mess. At this point we are just getting to updating a book, but we are no where near the end points that should have all been done by the end of the lab today. This weekend I am going to try to get the implementation done for the update, but after speaking with Allie, she told me to limit myself to 2 hours of work, which probably won't be anything crazy. I am a little disappointed with our progress, but it's time to move on and start focusing on our final project.
