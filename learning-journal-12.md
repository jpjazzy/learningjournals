# Adding charts to the Bus Mall project

Today was fairly easy, but I spent most of the day just playing with my chart properties to experiment.

Overall it was very easy to implement the chart because I already had all of the data generated dynamically. I simply linked that into the chart notation and it was functional. Some observations I had were the fact that adding properties were the most complicated part of editing the charts and the reason being is that there are so many nested properties that finding them can be a bit tedious. Everything else went fairly smoothly.
