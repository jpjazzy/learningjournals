# HEROKU AND DEPLOYMENT

Today was really difficult trying to get a handles bars template going with an immediately invoked function for apps to display data on the admin page. On top of that we spent extra time in lecture just trying to get Heroku deployed for the first time. It was over all very time consuming for me and I even had to skip lunch. No fun.
