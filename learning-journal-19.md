# Day before presentations!

I am not feeling very well today. I have spoken with my team and for the most part we have hit MVP. We are just thinking of stretch goals we can implement at this point. After speaking with my group and Brian, I am going to head home early today and try to get some reset before the big presentation tomorrow. Hope I'm not too sick!
