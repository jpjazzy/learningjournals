# Head first into javascript

Overall the project was very challenging. Even with my prior experience with javascript, the project still took a good amount of time and then needed html and styling on the pain pages on top of generating the javascript.

The most challenging part I had an issue with was inserting the HTML content into the DOM using javascript. To make the javascript pretty I pretty much re-used our general template generated on day 3 in the css experiment. Using CSS to alter the general appearance, I customized it to fit my needs.
