# Bus Mall project start

Over all the bus mall went pretty well. It's not as hard as the last one because I feel like we already have the tools to do what we need to do. I think the process went a lot smoother, even though it did take a while to figure out a few things. I had a question about an empty div property accessing in js, but I will look it later.
