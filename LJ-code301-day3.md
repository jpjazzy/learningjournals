# Completion of week 1!

301 is obviously set up significantly different. I will say I don't like the later lecture times. It both makes things really hard to retain, I get tired and just want to go home by the end, kind of zoning out.

I love the pair programming and working with someone new every day. Working with someone else really helps solidify concepts for me, even if I can do them, explaining them to someone else can be challenging. If I can explain it, then I know I get it.
