# 401 Learning Journal day 5

Today in lecture we learned how to test in jest with Enzyme. With this method we test the state, and not the dom. Learning react has been a little bit of a challenge, however I am really enjoying eing back in the front end and hope we continue to work with react until the end of this class. Since we haven't tested yest, we will have to see how it goes later today.
