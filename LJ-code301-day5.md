# Working with Node and SQL

It has been really different diving into node. Using the server.js instead of all view is definitely different from what we have been doing, but seeing how node can take your terminal and essentially turn it into a window on your terminal (minus the window and document objects), it really shows how you can use javascript to run web servers and have realtime javascript interaction.

After dabbing into SQL with the reading and tutorial content as well, it really is just like controlling an excell spreadsheet with word commands. I can see how it would be very useful to store huge amounts of data and easily manipulate it. Overall I think I am going to enjoy the back end much more, but we will see.
