## Learning journal day 6

Today we talked about middleware in react which essentially functions the same way that it did in middleware and other things we have worked with, but the way you set it up in react is a little different. Having Vinicio teach today was also a new take, which I enjoy. Hopefully we get to work with him more in the future.
