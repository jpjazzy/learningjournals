# Secret decoder ring updates!

We got our website to MVP and added a bunch of stretch goals such as storing keys, making the user put in their name, putting instructions on the site and more. We keep thinking of more things to add because we are pretty much done with everything to hit MVP so it's more about what we can do to improve our code.

I fixed my footer (dots showing on different lines), helped with adding form elements and localStorage. I also added a branch to an about me page for myself.

Fixing small bugs and git merge conflicts were the hardest part about today.
