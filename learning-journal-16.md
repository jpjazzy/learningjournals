# Project week!

This week is going to be a fun week, I can already tell. Our project is fairly easy to hit MVP, and we are really just working on stretch goals for the most part. We will see how the rest of the week goes, but since I mostly have the footer done, I am just going to be helping with other piece of the project. We have some pretty cool easter eggs coming along with our awesome general functionality. I think people will be impressed.
