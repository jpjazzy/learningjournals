# 401 Learning Journal day 3

Today was some new content about mongoDB. This week has been much better with the time off this weekend to just get some sleep and catch up on other things. I really hope more of the course is structured to give us time on the weekends to catch up, do things we don't get to during the week or get some sleep. 

Another thing I found is just closing my computer during the lecture helps me to focus with no distraction and not only understand better but think of more questions, be involved in the lecture discussion, and just get a general better experience. I will try to do that from now on and hopefully get a better 401 experience.
