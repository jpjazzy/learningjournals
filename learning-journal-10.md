# A day in the life of a developer

Today was a really fun day. We got to work in pairs and build a real mock up for a website. The thrill of finishing is easily one of the best things about programming. It's like watching a painting come together at the end after spending many hours doing it and just as exciting.

Me and my partner worked more in a driver and pilot type of scenario. We did most of the work collaboratively from Hector's computer. I added the js functionality for buttons and merged it while he went and had a cigarette. I would say me and hector both did about 50/50 other than the js which only took a minute or two.

I thought this would take a few hours (3-4) but it ended up taking about 6.

If I had to put a price on this, I would say :

$30/hr * 6 hours * 2 [for two people] = $360.

To make the job a nice even amount, I would say $400 is a fair price and puts us both at about $33/hr.

Although CSS can be very frustrating sometimes, building something like this to completion (which could be a potential client mockup) makes me feel really good about my future designs as a web developer. It's definitely a confidence boost.
