# CSS and javascript animation playground

I added a new color scheme to the site along with some animation and and a cleaner feel. Trying to make transitions work with javascript and css didn't end up working for me though even though I just toggle between a class. I learned that css modification with CSS is a lot more tricky than it sounds.

Overall playing with themes and colors is very fun, however trying to get styling to come together how it does in your head is near impossible sometimes.
