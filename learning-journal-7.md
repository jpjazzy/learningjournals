# Constructor functions and loops

Today went pretty well and I learned how to create constructor functions. I didn't have a chance to do the reading like I usually do before hand to know where the class was going, but it worked out fine. I changed all my previous code for pats salmon cookies to use constructors and methods (via prototype) on them. I also implemented a table type format rather than a list. It was actually a lot harder to do that I thought, but I worked through it, even with the nested loops.

Overall I am not quite done for the day, but it was a very successful learning day, like always.
