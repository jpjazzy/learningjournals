# A refresher and first look into form data

I have used forms before, but a lot has changed since the last time I did. With HTML5 you can do things like check fields without the use of javascript. Today we went into writing our salmon cookies table to use a form to add information.

Over all the changes went very smoothly. Forms are pretty easy to use and making my code more modular with all the methods and functions the past few days has made the changes much easier to implement. Over all forms are very easy to use and the <fieldset></fieldset> tag is very handy in handling elements in a form via css. In the book it shows to use it more as a UX element, but this way is functionally much better.
