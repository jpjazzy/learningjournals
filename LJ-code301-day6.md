# SQL and functional programming

The last few days have been very challenging as I am working with PostgreSQL. I haven't had any real experience with databases so trying to learn SQL is definitely a challenge, but I am getting there. This was however the first time I was afraid I wasn't going to have a lab done on time. Functional programming using higher order functions is also something we have been talking about, but it is something I have been using for a long time.

I did a few katas for practice on a few of the array methods which use these types of functions and it only took minimal time.
