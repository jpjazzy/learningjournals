## 401 Learning Journal day 2

So far has been pretty fun, especially the TCP chat server the other day, however today has been a lot harder. Trying to get my routes for testing has proved to be a challenge and scott was out of the building today so I could not ask clarifying questions. I will do my best to get everything turned in tonight, but today has definitely been a struggle. On top of the struggle, seeing the fact that things I think are completely to my standards get low grades is a little heartbreaking. Specifically on TCP chat server, my code works for every piece on my own computer. I did a test on a windows computer, and telnet functions differently, accepting any input as a data trigger, however on mac and linux, the data event trigger is the enter key, so if you use windows you will only ever get one letter or the @ symbol off. If I wasn't grade on windows, I have no idea why the project wouldn't work as I tested on both mac and linux. If it was graded on windows, I have no idea how to change the trigger for data, so it's a lose lose for me. I will talk to someone to get more information later, but I also understand with the time crunch required for learning all the material in this course, going back and doing extra work to pull up your grade can also be difficult or impossible.

On top of that, being deducted a full point on whiteboarding for a simple mistake is much more impactful when you are only getting 5 points max. I feel like there should be some kind of percentage of a point deduction if any there. The only time a whiteboarding really should even be deducted in my opinion is if the function doesn't work, not based on file structure since it is simply one function and tests.
