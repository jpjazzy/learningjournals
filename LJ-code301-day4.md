# UI Challenge and working with ajax

Today we went over ajax to give us a preface to interfacing with servers using the View, Controller, Model (MVC) layout. We also used UI challenge to move boxes in mobile and desktop view. Over all today wasn't too hard, but the work over the weekend was quite a bit more than we used to get. I hope I can figure out some kind of pattern to give me more of my weekend back, but we will see.
