# Project Week - Secret Decoder Ring - Wednesday

Today we implemented multiple pieces of functionality for ease of use to do with copy and pasting, added animation and clarity to the copy button functionality, added content and styled the about us page, fixed list items not showing right (now they even keep your storage if you register as someone else and come back) and more. I touched on all aspects improved today.

The most challenging part, as with all week has been merging. Some people are very behind with their main branches when commiting major parts, which inevitably causes major bugs when merging. This happened many times today and we even had to roll our main branch back because of issues with the about me page.
