# Learning journal 14

Today was fairly simple and no actual coding, mostly just working on hashing out what projects everyone will be working on and coming up with ideas. I got put into the following project and my team helped generate a readme file similar to a format of what our labs look like.

# Class 14 Project – Secret Decoder Ring

# Technical Requirements (MVP):
• Make a home page with clear instructions
Take text and encrypt it or decrypt it based on user needs (2 buttons and text fields)
•	Use HTML/CSS/Javascript
•	Use all elements accumulating to what we have learned so far (forms, object constructors, loops, a well thought our UI/UX, manipulate the DOM, use animations, use charts, use localStorage, using a lib)
•	Load onto live GitHubPage
•	Show up every day and summarize problems, meet with Brian, and touch base

# Stretch goals:
•	Make about us page
•	Add hidden easter eggs
•	Encode based on key

# Group Agreements
Show up every day and summarize problems (9 am), meet with Brian (10 am), and touch base with group on what needs to be done.
