# Diving into paired programming

Today was a very productive day and my first experience into paired programming.

The pair programming process went very well. Me and Hector worked together by creating a function and rewriting our code so the same functionality was present using functions.
I learned how to explain functions and what is happening in the code more clearly.

The most difficult part of the assignment was learning how to vocalize what a function actually does and where misunderstandings happened.

Working with Hector was easy due to his calm demeanor.

Sometimes working as a programmer isn't always about learning to do something with code so much as learning to communicate with your piers more effectively.
