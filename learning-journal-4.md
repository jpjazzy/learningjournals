# Designing our first website prototype

Today was a very another very productive day and I assume this will be the case with the entirety of the rest of my CodeFellows journey.

Today was a lecture mixed with a real dive into the life of a developer in every way. We had a layout that was simply a picture with dimensions and what we did was first lecture and then design just like a developer would when given a template by a designer. I found this process fascinating and I really enjoyed it.

Learning how to code in chrome to design visually is a huge plus and I know I am going to enjoy that because chrome is free and it's a powerful editor.

I look forward to the next classes.
